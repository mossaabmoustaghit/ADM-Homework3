# ADM-Homework3
This files contains all the exercises related to the 3rd Homework except the bonus one. The first cell of code contains all the libraries to be used in order to carry out all the "activities" required later on. 
The first exercises asked us to develop a code that extract the list of Anime's in txt file. In particular, We have managed to implement code that not only extracts what is required but that manages to overtake bots automatically, thus reducing the time it would have taken otherwise. 
In second and third exercises we have implemented 3 different search engines that, in  order:
1. compares the words entered in the input box with the document. If all the words are contained in the document then we retrieve requested information
2. compares the words entered in the input box and the document through the cosine similarity
3. compares compares the words entered in the input box and the document through the cosine similarity and the presence of the word inserted in the document

The 5th exercise contains an algorithm that provides the best sequence of appointments in terms of minutes for a personal trainer.
